## Software characteristics 

- *Software reliability* describes the ability of a system to keep functioning under  
  specific use over a specific period.  
- *Software usability* is the degree of how the users find the software product easy to use.  
  It describes the overall user experience with the product.  
- *Fault tolerance* is the capability of the software product to maintain a  
  specified level of performance or to recover from faults such as software faults,  
  environment failures, wrong use of interface, or incorrect input.  
- *Software maintainability* is defined as the degree to which an application is understood,  
  repaired, or enhanced.  


# Processes 

 - *Linting*: the process of running a program that statically analyses code for potential errors.
   The code in question is not run.  
 - *Debugging*: debugging is the process of identifying and removing errors from a computer program.
   It localizes and corrects faults.  
 - *Software testing*:  process of checking the quality, functionality, and performance of the software
   under test by validation and verification. The goal of testing is the systematic detection of failures.

Linting and debugging is usually done by developers. Testing is done by testers.
