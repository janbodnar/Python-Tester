# Python-Tester
Python testing course

 - Linting: the process of running a program that statically analyses code for potential errors.
   The code in question is not run. 
 - Debugging: debugging is the process of identifying and removing errors from a computer program.
   It localizes and corrects faults. 
 - Software testing:  process of checking the quality, functionality, and performance of the software
   under test by validation and verification. The goal of testing is the  systematic detection of failures.


Linting and debugging is usually done by developers. Testing is done by testers.
