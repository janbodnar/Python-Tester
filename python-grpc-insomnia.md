# Python gRPC & Insomnia

Sure, Jan! Here's a short and clear introduction to **gRPC**:

---

### What is gRPC?

**gRPC** (short for *gRPC Remote Procedure Call*) is an open-source framework developed by Google that enables  
communication between distributed systems using a high-performance, language-agnostic protocol. It allows clients  
to call methods on a server as if they were local functions, making it ideal for microservices and real-time applications.

gRPC uses:

- **Protocol Buffers (Protobuf)** for efficient binary serialization
- **HTTP/2** as its transport protocol, enabling multiplexing and streaming

### Advantages of gRPC

- **High Performance:** Binary serialization and HTTP/2 make gRPC significantly faster and more efficient  
  than traditional REST APIs.
- **Streaming Support:** Supports client, server, and bidirectional streaming for real-time data exchange.  
- **Cross-language Compatibility:** Works across many languages like Go, Python, Java, C++, and more.  
- **Automatic Code Generation:** Protobuf definitions generate client and server code, reducing boilerplate.  
- **Strong Typing:** Protobuf enforces strict data contracts, reducing runtime errors.

### Disadvantages of gRPC

- **Limited Browser Support:** Browsers don’t natively support gRPC over HTTP/2, requiring workarounds like gRPC-Web.
- **Steeper Learning Curve:** Developers must learn Protobuf and gRPC-specific tooling.
- **Debugging Complexity:** Binary messages are not human-readable, making manual inspection harder.
- **Overhead for Simple Use Cases:** For basic CRUD APIs, REST might be simpler and more accessible.


In short, gRPC is a powerful tool for building fast, scalable APIs—especially when performance and real-time communication 
matter.
